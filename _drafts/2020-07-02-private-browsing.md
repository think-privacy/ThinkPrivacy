One of the most misunderstood features on most modern browsers is Private Mode, or sometimes called Incognito mode. When I am offering advice on measures people can take in their privacy such as using a private search engine or a VPN, I am told, “I don’t need those, I use private browsing mode all the time.” Worse, I have seen people in office environments using private browsing on their work computers, visiting personal sites such as social media or shopping.

This is because a vast majority of people who use private browsing, unfortunately, don’t understand the limitations of the feature. In a [recent study](https://elie.net/blog/privacy/understanding-how-people-use-private-browsing/), 54% of people who use private browsing claim to use it to hide from the websites they visit, while 20% used it to hide from the internet provider. Two things private browsing absolutely does not protect users from.
