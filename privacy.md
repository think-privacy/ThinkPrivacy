This website (thinkprivacy.io) does not use Google Analytics or other invasive tracking software. Instead, we use Matamo, a free and open-source software that respects your privacy.

Matamo anonymizes and truncates all visitor IP addresses (non-identifiable), while also supporting “do no track” browser settings. This protects the privacy of our visitors, while also providing us with information to improve the site – such as showing which articles/guides are most popular.

When you leave ThinkPrivacy via our links, we cannot vouche for the tracking or cookies used by sites we recommend, however if you use the browser plugins we recommend, you help reduce what they can track. In most cases, they care deeply about privacy as well and don't use invasive tracking software.

We don't use cookies, and when possible we host all scripts on our site. If we host any scripts offsite, we ensure they do not include any tracking software or cookies. Your visit to this site is as anonymous as we can make it.

Put simply, we do not track you and we do not know who you are.
