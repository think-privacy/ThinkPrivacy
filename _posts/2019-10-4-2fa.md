A password isn't enough and even the most unique password can be leaked and discovered by bad actors. Two-factor authentication (2FA) offers another level of protection by using an app to deliver you an always changing, timed code to use once you enter your password. 

A note of caution: if a website offers 2FA, always choose the option to use either an app or even a hardware key, but avoid SMS. While SMS is still better than no 2FA, SMS messages can be intercepted and are not as secure.

<p><strong>Use Instead Of:</strong> Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
