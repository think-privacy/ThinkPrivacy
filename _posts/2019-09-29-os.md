If you have a choice in your OS, we strongly recommended ditching MacOS or Windows and moving to a Linux driven system. Yet, even with Linux you have choices to make.

Below are our favorite Linux distributions but you have way more choices. Not sure where to start? Check out [**Try Linux**](https://trylinux.today) and see what other options are out there for you. Just keep in mind, not all of the options on Try Linux respect your privacy the same.

<p><strong>Use Instead Of:</strong> Windows, MacOS.</p>
