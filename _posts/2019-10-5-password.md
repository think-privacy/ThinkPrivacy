Do yourself a favor, never use the same password twice. Even better, you shouldn't even know what your password is. This is where a password manager comes in. You don't have to remember all of your passwords, and if a password is exposed, you only have one to change. 

<p><strong>Use Instead Of:</strong> Using the same password for every website login.</p>
