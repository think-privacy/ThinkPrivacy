Cloud storage is a convenient way to keep files synced to all of your devices, but not all companies respect that these are your files. Dropbox, Google, and others can terminate your account or lock you out without warning, leaving you with no way to access your files. Worse, some even write into their terms of service that they have a right to read and use your files as needed.

Some of the services below allow you self-host on your own home servers such as a Raspberry Pi, but for those who want to let another company manage their servers, we recommend hosting at [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/1c2110f7156e) or [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com0.

<p><strong>Use Instead Of:</strong> Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Sync, iCloud.</p>
