In 2013, Edward Snowden, a contractor with the NSA, leaked documents to journalists that exposed the United States mass surveillance program of Americans’ telephone records. When Snowden leaked the documents, he fled immediately to Russia as he was, and still is, facing US espionage changes.

However, seven years later on September 2, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said that the U.S. surveillance of phone records was indeed illegal. In the ruling they said “the metadata collection exceeded the scope of Congress’s authorization … which required the government to make a showing of relevance to a particular authorized investigation before collecting the records …” and the U.S. government agency went as far as to give credit to Snowden for exposing the practice.

Given that the U.S. Court of Appeals, and many leading US politicians, including President Trump have now come to Snowden’s defense, there is only one course of action left to take: the U.S. must pardon Snowden and allow him to safely return to his family and home country the United States.
