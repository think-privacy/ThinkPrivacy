A DNS resolver, such as the ones listed below, help prevent such things as DNS hijacking, or can be used to block malicious sites, block ads, and trackers. These resolvers don't make you anonymous or hide your traffic from your ISP but they do still help keep you safer online.

iOS 14+ users who do not wish to install a 3rd party app can use the built in DNS feature and find profiles from  your favorite providers at [Encrypted DNS Party](https://encrypted-dns.party/){:target="_blank"}.

<p><strong>Use:</strong> Instead of the DNS provided by your ISP, Google DNS.</p>
