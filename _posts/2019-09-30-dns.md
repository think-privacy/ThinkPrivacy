A DNS resolver, such as the ones listed below, help prevent such things as DNS hijacking, or can be used to block malicious sites, block ads, and trackers. These resolvers don't make you anonymous or hide your traffic from your ISP but they do still help keep you safer online.  

<p><strong>Use:</strong> Instead of the DNS provided by your ISP, Google DNS.</p>
