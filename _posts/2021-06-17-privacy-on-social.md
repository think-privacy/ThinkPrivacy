If someone asked me how to be more private on Instagram, you’d probably tell them to delete it. They are owned by Facebook after all, so being private on Facebook is like asking to swim in a lake while in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Sure, it sounds good, but it’s not realistic. 

Yet, it’s also not realistic to assume everyone will just delete these social media platforms. The reason they are so successful is because they deliver on their promise. They connect us around the world, to friends, families, and strangers. We can grow our business, stay in touch with friends from school, and meet new friends with similar interests. Furthermore, new ideas such as awareness of private rights and tools can be discussed and spread here.

The truth is, you have to meet people where they are, and if Startpage, or any other privacy focused company didn’t make an effort to reach people on social media, they would be selling the public short.
