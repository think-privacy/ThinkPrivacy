**CAN I REQUEST OR SUGGEST AN ALTERNATIVE?**

Yes, of course!

The best way to contribute or make recommendations is to contact us through [Github](https://gitlab.com/ThinkPrivacy/thinkprivacy.io){:target="_blank"}



**CAN I QUOTE THINKPRIVACYS’S TEXT ON MY OWN SITE? CAN I TRANSLATE THINKPRIVACY INTO ANOTHER LANGUAGE?**

Yes, the text on ThinkPrivacy is available under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0. Please remember to link back to ThinkPrivacy if you use content from this site.



**DO YOU HAVE A PATREON, LIBERAPAY OR OTHER DONATION SERVICE TO SUPPORT THE SITE?**

Yes! You can visit our [**Donate page**](donate.html) for more information about how you can help support ThinkPrivacy.



**HOW DO YOU DEFINE “PRIVACY-CONSCIOUS” AND “ETHICAL”?**

The idea of this site is to provide alternatives that have better privacy but are as easy to use as whatever they replace. These are referred to on this site as “privacy-conscious”.

There are usually other alternatives that provide a higher level of privacy but require technical knowledge that most people don’t have.

The word “ethical” is used in many different ways in modern English. On this site it’s used to mean services and apps that do significantly less harm to people’s privacy, because this site regards user privacy as morally good.

None of the alternatives listed are perfect, but they are better options.



**WHY ISN’T BRAVE LISTED IN THE BROWSER ALTERNATIVES?**

Brave is a commercial company funded by venture capital and its business model is built around advertising. They block ads on sites you browse, and replace them with their own ads. Other companies that have combined VC money with online ad-based business models have always ended up invading people’s privacy, sooner or later.

Also, Peter Thiel (the head of Palantir and a member of Facebook’s board of directors) is a major investor in Brave.

**We do NOT and will not recommend using Brave.**
