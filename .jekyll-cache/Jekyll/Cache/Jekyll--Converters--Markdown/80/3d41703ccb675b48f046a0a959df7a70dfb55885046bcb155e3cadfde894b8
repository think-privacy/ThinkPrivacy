<p><strong>HOW DO YOU DEFINE ‚ÄúPRIVACY-CONSCIOUS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúETHICAL‚Äù?</strong></p>

<p>The idea of this site is to provide alternatives that have better privacy but are as easy to use as whatever they replace. These are referred to on this site as ‚Äúprivacy-conscious‚Äù.</p>

<p>There are usually other alternatives that provide a higher level of privacy but require technical knowledge that most people don‚Äôt have. For those products, we have listed their difficulty in the table.</p>

<p>The word ‚Äúethical‚Äù is used in many different ways in modern English. On this site it‚Äôs used to mean services and apps that do significantly less harm to people‚Äôs privacy, because this site regards user privacy as morally good.</p>

<p>None of the alternatives listed are perfect, but they are better options.</p>

<p><strong>WHY ISN‚ÄôT BRAVE LISTED IN THE BROWSER ALTERNATIVES?</strong></p>

<p>Brave is a commercial company funded by venture capital and its business model is built around advertising. They block ads on sites you browse, and replace them with their own ads. Other companies that have combined VC money with online ad-based business models have always ended up invading people‚Äôs privacy, sooner or later.</p>

<p>Also, Peter Thiel (the head of Palantir and a member of Facebook‚Äôs board of directors) is a major investor in Brave.</p>

<p><strong>We do NOT recommend using Brave.</strong></p>
