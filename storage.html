												<tr>
													<td><a href="https://nextcloud.com" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a></td>
													<td>This is the top option for those more interested in self-hosting their cloud files. While some services do offer NextCloud as a subscription, I highly recommended going the self-hosted route with this.</td>
													<td>Free - Enterprise</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td><a href="https:/owncloud.org" target="_blank">ownCloud</a></td>
													<td>The original cloud service that actually spawned NextCloud. Arguably less feature rich and less developed than NextCloud, still a great product used by many.</td>
													<td>Free - Enterprise</td>

													<td><a href="https://tresorit.com/" target="_blank">Tresorit</a></td>
													<td>If you're not able to self-host, I can't think of a better solution than Tresorit. Well priced and feature rich, this will make you forget about Dropbox the first time you open it.</td>

												<tr>
													<td><a href="/a/pcloud/" target="_blank">pCloud</a><sup>*</sup></td>
													<td>A Switzerland based clould storage company with zero-knowledge encryption. This is a great cross-platform solution for replacing Dropbox.</td>

													<td><a href="pcloud.com" target="_blank">Yes</a></td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td><a href="https://spideroak.com/one/" target="_blank">SpiderOak One</a></td>
													<td>Secure, encrypted, zero-knowledge cloud file storage. Cross platform and easy to use. This is a great solution for backing up your files, but does not work as a great solution for a Dropbox replacement as the mobile app lacks features.</td>
